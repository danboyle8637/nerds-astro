Most e-commerce owners give their products a lame paragraph of "sales" copy.

And it's hardly sales copy. It's a **bleached out description nobody cares to read** because there's no reason to.

Your products... especially the HOT products... deserve words that **add some pizzaz and polish** so conversion rates go to the moon.

That's what we'll do for your e-commerce products.

<BaseSubhead>What You Get</BaseSubhead>

Based on whether you choose short punchy description copy or long sales page copy...

You'll get sales copy that get's your **add to cart button clicked** more than...

Short description:

  <BaseBullet>400 words</BaseBullet>
</UnorderedList>

Long Sales Page Copy:

<UnorderedList>
  <BaseBullet>2 to 4 sections of body copy</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>1 call to action</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>500 to 700 words</BaseBullet>
</UnorderedList>
