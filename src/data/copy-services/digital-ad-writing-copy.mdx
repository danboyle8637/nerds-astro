Are you buying Google ads?

Maybe Facebook ads... or even Tik Tok ads?

If your ads **aren't getting clicked**... you're wasting money.

If your ads **aren't getting clicked by the right people**... you're wasting money.

We'll study your ideal prospect and write ads that will **deliver quality clicks** to your landing pages or product pages.

<BaseSubhead>What You Get</BaseSubhead>

**If you choose Google ads you'll get**:

<UnorderedList>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="2 Google Responsive Search ads"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="15 headlines per ad"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="4 descriptions per ad"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet type="check" bullet="8 images per ad"></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="Site extensions NOT included in ad pack"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
</UnorderedList>

**If you choose Facebook ads you'll get**:

<UnorderedList>
  <PunctuationBullet type="check" bullet="2 Facebook ads"></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet type="check" bullet="2 custom images"></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="No video unless you have your own video already"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet
    type="check"
    bullet="2 sets of description body copy"
  ></PunctuationBullet>
  <PunctuationBullet type="check" bullet="4 headlines"></PunctuationBullet>
</UnorderedList>

I'll also provide you some strategy on implementing the ads based on your current ad account performance.

<BaseSubhead>How It Works</BaseSubhead>

**Choose the platform** you want ads for.

You won't be able to purchase more than one set of ads. Too many and testing takes too long.

**Click the button to purchase your ad copy**.

On the thank you page, you'll fill out a short campaign discover form.

I'll reach out for a short 20 minute follow up call.

And I'll deliver your ads so you can start running them.

This is just ad copy... NOT account management.
