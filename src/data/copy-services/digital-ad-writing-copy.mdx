Are you buying Google ads?

Maybe Facebook ads... or even Tik Tok ads?

If your ads **aren't getting clicked**... you're wasting money.

If your ads **aren't getting clicked by the right people**... you're wasting money.

We'll study your ideal prospect and write ads that will **deliver quality clicks** to your landing pages or product pages.

<BaseSubhead>What You Get</BaseSubhead>

**If you choose Google ads you'll get**:

<UnorderedList>
  <BaseBullet>4 Google Responsive Search ads</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>15 headlines per ad</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>4 descriptions per ad</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>Site extensions not included in ad pack</BaseBullet>
</UnorderedList>

**If you choose Facebook ads you'll get**:

<UnorderedList>
  <BaseBullet>2 Facebook ads</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>2 custom images</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>No video unless you have your own video already</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>2 sets of description body copy</BaseBullet>
  <BaseBullet>4 headlines</BaseBullet>
</UnorderedList>

I'll also provide you some strategy on implementing the ads based on your current ad account performance.

<BaseSubhead>How It Works</BaseSubhead>

**Choose the platform** you want ads for.

You won't be able to purchase more than one set of ads. Too many and testing takes too long.

**Click the button to purchase your ad copy**.

On the thank you page, you'll fill out a short campaign discover form.

I'll reach out for a short 20 minute follow up call.

And I'll deliver your ads so you can start running them.

This is just ad copy... NOT account management.
