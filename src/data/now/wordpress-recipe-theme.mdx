I know how to use Wordpress (WP, going forward). I understand the idea behind how it's coded and why.

But **I never built a Wordpress site from scratch**.

I never got into the WP functions and methods.

And WP is changing so fast with Gutenberg... I wanted to make sure I know the ins and outs.

I've read they are floating the idea of making core WP use plugins for nearly all additional features... to keep core lightweight. That's a big change.

Plus **I do take on clients in a case by case basis**.

And since nearly every small to medium sized business has a website built with Wordpress... it makes sense to master 80% of the WP functionality.

80% is good enough in this case.

## Brad Schiff - Wordpress for Developers

I am going through Brads course on Wordpress. You can find it on Udemy.

It's a HUGE course. Brad talks really slow... so he's great for beginners. I tend to speed up the videos.

**I definitely recommend his courses if you're new to coding**.

I enjoy going through the course because as he builds features, I will pause the video and build it before he does.

I'll learn what I can on my own and then compare my solutions to his.

For the Wordpress stuff so far, I'm learning a lot.

For the Javascript stuff, I'm still learning a lot. It's fun to see how other developers solve problems.

## Deadline: February 28, 2023

I want to build **a complete recipe Wordpress theme** from scratch... coded well enough and packed with the right features to get accepted into ThemeForest or some similar marketplace.

I want it to be a Block based and maybe even plugin based if that comes to fruition.

Why a recipe theme?

**Kindal is a great cook** and I really want her to start recording her recipes. So what better way to cement my Wordpress knowledge than build a theme that will actually get used.
