Word <Link type="external" url="http://fitwomensweekly.com">Fit Women's Weekly</Link> is Kindal and I's online fitness business.

Our marketing site has been in production for about two years. It's going through some transformations to say the least.

Currently it's built with <Link type="external" url="https://nextjs.org/">NextJs</Link>.

**It's also in dire need or an update**.

<UnorderedList>
  <Bullet type="blue">We are dialing in our offerings.</Bullet>
  <Bullet type="blue">We are dialing in the offers to get customers.</Bullet>
  <Bullet type="blue">And I need to tweak the design slightly as well.</Bullet>
</UnorderedList>

This is a good chance to port it to <Link type="external" url="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link> or <Link type="external" url="https://qwik.builder.io/">Qwik</Link>.

I've really enjoyed building Nerds in Astro (for the most part). It's a great solution for so many use cases online.

Plus porting it won't be that big of a challenge. The hardest part for me is using **CSS modules in my SolidJS components**.

That extra CSS file as opposed to having the CSS directly in the component file... it's a headache to deal with.

Yes, you read that correctly. I will switch the React components that need interaction to SolidJS. I really enjoy Solid compared to React. That sounds like an opinion blog post.

## Deadline: November 1, 2022

**By November 1, 2022 I want**...

<UnorderedList>
  <Bullet type="important">
    An organized Figma file with every detail of my update mapped out.
  </Bullet>
  <Bullet type="important">A catalog of the new components I need.</Bullet>
  <Bullet type="important">
    A process to update and change existing components over to better versions.
  </Bullet>
  <Bullet type="important">
    And I want to know which components I want to add to my personal component
    library.
  </Bullet>
</UnorderedList>

The biggest mistake I've made over the last few years of building websites and the few apps I have built...

_Not FULLY designing them in Figma first_.

And I mean every possible view and state the UI could have... including error states.

I am making a promise to myself here... **I will design EVERYTHING first before I start building in code**.

I made this mistake back with Nerds. I got excited and started coding before everything was designed. It slows the process down so much.
