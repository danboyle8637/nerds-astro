[Fit Women's Weekly](https://fitwomensweekly.com/) is Kindal and I's online fitness business.

Our marketing site has been in production for about two years. It's going through some transformations to say the least.

Currently its [build with NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

**It's also in dire need or an update**.

- We are dialing in our offerings.
- We are dialing in the offers to get customers.
- And I need to tweak the design slightly as well.

This is a good chance to port it to [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/).

I've really enjoyed building Nerds in Astro. It's a great solution for so many use cases online.

Plus porting it won't be that big of a challenge. The hardest part for me is using CSS modules in my SolidJS components.

That extra CSS file as opposed to having the CSS directly in the component file... it's a headache to deal with.

Yes, you read that correctly. I will switch the React components that need interaction to SolidJS. I really enjoy Solid compared to React. That sounds like an opinion blog post.

## Deadline: November 1, 2022

**By November 1, 2022 I want**...

- An organized Figma file with every detail of my update mapped out.
- A catalog of the new components I need.
- A process to update and change existing components over to better versions.
- And I want to know which components I want to add to my personal component library.

The biggest mistake I've made over the last few years of building websites and the few apps I have built...

**Not FULLY designing them in Figma first**.

And I mean every possible view and state the UI could have... including error states.

I am making a promise to myself here... **I will design EVERYTHING first before I start building in code**.

I made this mistake back with Nerds. I got excited and started coding before everything was designed. It slows the process down so much.
